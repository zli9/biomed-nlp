The repository stores codes for assignments of **Hands-on Machine Learning Lab SS 2022**. The focus of this one-week laboratory class is NLP with different tasks every day:
- Day1: Understanding your data
- Day2: Sequence Classification with Traditional NLP Methods
- Day3: Sentence Classification with pretraining LLM (ELECTRA)
- Day4: Sentiment Analysis with pretraining LLM (BERT)
- Day5: Presentation

There are two publicly available datasets are used in the lab:
1. [Drug Review Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/462/drug+review+dataset+drugs+com) used for sentiment analysis
2. [PubMed 200k RCT Dataset](https://github.com/Franck-Dernoncourt/pubmed-rct) used for sentence classification

At the end of the lab, submitted the report named *Applications of machine learning in biomedical natural language processing*.
